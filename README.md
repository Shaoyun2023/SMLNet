🔍Highlights
---
● **First SPD Manifold Learning for Fusion**  
Our work is the first to introduce Riemannian manifold networks (SPD manifolds) into image fusion tasks, enabling geometrically consistent modeling of cross-modal correlations.

● **Manifold-Aware Attention**  
We propose a novel SPD Attention Module (SPDAM) that dynamically weights cross-modal features on the manifold space, enhancing complementary information fusion while suppressing redundancies. 

● **Superior Performance & Efficiency**  
Extensive experiments show SMLNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fusion quality (e.g., EN, VIF) and computational efficiency, with proven gains in downstream tasks like object detection.
